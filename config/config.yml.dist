# Set the encryption to use for the passwords. Options are:
#  - plaintext: No encryption is used, passwords are plain text. Not very good.
#  - md5: basic one-way hashing. Not very good, but better than plaintext.
#  - password_hash: Good, proper one-way hashing. This is the preferred option.
# To generate hashed passwords for your visitors, go to
# `/bolt/generatepasswords` to create password hashes. Note that you must be
# logged on to the Bolt backend, to do so.
